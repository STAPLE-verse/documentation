glossary_add("FAIR", "FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, a set of guiding principles that aim to improve the management and stewardship of scientific data, metadata, and other research outputs. Originally proposed by Wilkinson et al. (2016), the FAIR principles emphasize that data should be findable through rich metadata and persistent identifiers; accessible using standardized protocols, even when access is restricted; interoperable via the use of shared formats, vocabularies, and ontologies; and reusable by ensuring clear licensing, documentation, and provenance. FAIR is not a strict standard but a framework to guide the development of research practices and infrastructure that support transparency, reproducibility, and long-term reuse by both humans and machines.", replace = TRUE )
glossary_add("metadata", "Metadata is information that describes other data. It helps explain what a dataset or research output is, how it was created, who created it, and how it can be used. Metadata makes data easier to find, understand, and reuse.")
