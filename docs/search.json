    "text": "1 Preface\nScientific research has become increasingly complex, requiring specialized skills, interdisciplinary work, and collaboration among large teams. Managing such projects and tracking data and metadata has become a significant challenge. The need for FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable Wilkinson et al., 2016) open data, materials, and metadata has similarly grown, especially considering recent mandates for required sharing for federally funded projects (Rep. Foxx, 2019; Rep. Ryan, 2019). While user-friendly software tools that help researchers structure metadata exist, few researchers are aware of their necessity and usefulness, the onus is still on the project team to collect and curate this information. Studies using teams of researchers require sophisticated tracking of all project elements, and therefore, there is a need for scientific project management software that is tailored to the management of all manner of science projects. Software that promotes best practices in FAIR data and metadata would increase openness in all reporting, and tracking, and reporting standards.\nCurrently, the tools and websites designed for researchers are focused on getting researchers to share their materials, code, and data (i.e., Open Science Framework, FigShare, Zenodo. These repositories represent a necessary resource for long-term storage of outputs, but do not help researchers organize or track information during the life of a study. Project management software, like Asana, Monday, or ClickUp, are designed from a business perspective that is not tailored to scientific research. While the features that scientific research requires may be found in some individual project management software, no current solution provides all the essential features, such as the ability to assign tasks at different scales (e.g., teams, individuals), integrated metadata, fully transparent access to all information in the project manager, and long-term storage that complies with international data privacy regulations. Project management software is designed to get things done rather than document the way a project was completed, so attempts to use existing software for these features often involve ‘hacking’ it to extract necessary records.\nTo this end, we developed STAPLE (Science Tracking Across the Project LifEspan), which not only helps with the unique challenges of project management of research but includes open and transparent documentation of data and metadata, as well as providing templates for minimum metadata collection. STAPLE allows users to add project components based on research type, assign timelines, delegate tasks to individuals or groups, and link to long-term storage of research outputs. STAPLE helps track authorship credit and contributor roles via tasks or contributors. STAPLE includes default metadata standards for documenting common research outputs and is fully open-source, enabling community input and adaptation. Designed for global reach, STAPLE supports the transition to open science by including researchers and outputs that are often overlooked, regardless of technical expertise. Through its point-and-click interface, and downloadable documentation outputs, STAPLE makes it easier for all researchers to participate in transparent, inclusive, and reproducible science.\n\n\n\n\nRep.

    "text": "The STAPLE mission: Project Management software that allows you to document your research project to improve transparency.\nAs researchers, we must balance attention to the big picture: the overarching goals, timelines, theories, and hypotheses of a project, with the smaller goals and tasks required to realize those ambitions. While most researchers receive training in designing studies, collecting and analyzing data, and publishing findings, formal instruction in project management is rare. Instead, these skills are often acquired informally, modeled within the research lab environment and shaped by a supervisor’s style. Each project also introduces unique needs and circumstances, and even the addition of a single collaborator can generate new layers of coordination and complexity.\nEvidence indicates that the number of co-authors and collaborators on research projects has increased steadily over time (Wuchty et al., 2007). Advances in digital communication and collaboration tools such as Zoom, GitHub, and Google Workspace, combined with the globalization of research, have enabled teams to work together across great distances and disciplinary boundaries (Cummings & Kiesler, 2005, 2007). Large-scale collaborations are increasingly encouraged, not only to tackle ambitious scientific questions, but also to enhance the diversity of participants, researchers, and cultures represented in data (Adan, 2023; Moshontz et al., 2018; Swartz et al., 2019). The inclusion of multiple collaborators, each embedded in different lab cultures, institutions, geopolitical contexts, and languages, increases the complexity of managing research projects.\nSo why do we need software?\nGeneral project management platforms, such as Asana, Monday, ClickUp, and Trello, are widely used in business settings, but they were designed around business-oriented workflows and templates. Research projects, however, present unique challenges that do not map neatly onto these models. Scientific projects often require coordination of specialized tasks such as research design, ethical approval, data collection across multiple sites, metadata documentation, open data sharing, and publication requirements (Borghi & Gulick, 2021; Fecher & Friesike, 2014).\nLarge-scale collaborations have experimented with adapting existing structures, sometimes treating multi-team projects like classrooms or leveraging educational technologies, but these solutions are partial fits at best. What researchers need is a system that recognizes the scientific lifecycle: from ideas and preregistration, to data collection, to analysis, dissemination, and long-term archiving. STAPLE is designed for scientists, by scientists. It was built with input not only from researchers but also from key stakeholders in the broader research ecosystem, including funders, librarians, and journals, ensuring that the software supports transparency, reproducibility, and effective project management across diverse scientific contexts.\nSo what’s the deal with documentation?\nIn tandem with the encouragement for interdisciplinary, diverse teams, researchers have begun to focus on the improvement of science through transparency and sharing. The Transparency and Openness guidelines establish ideals for projects to be reproducible, open, and transparency through data sharing, code/analysis sharing, materials sharing, pre-registration, and replication (Grant et al., 2025). Journals require different levels of sharing for publication, which has pushed researchers to begin to implement these practices. However, the simple sharing of data, code, and materials does not make them FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (Wilkinson et al., 2016). Simple sharing of data does not necessarily allow someone to find that data in relation to the research project, or allow a researcher to know what V1 means in the data, or even reuse part of the data.\nCreating adequate documentation for the reuse of any output from a project can be difficult. There are often no clear standards, the work can be time consuming, and is often left to the end of a project when important details may have been forgotten. STAPLE is designed to encourage you to document information along the way and to provide guidance with what you should include with each document. As you complete specific task, such as create your materials for a study, you will be able to link your project to those materials and include information to interpret and understand those documents. We provide a set of minimum documentation standards for multiple types of documents - and the ability for you to include extra information if your field has set standards.\nOk, so that’s transparent?\nSTAPLE allows you to track and run your project - and then include research outputs from that project. Each step of the way, STAPLE collects data about who did what and when. If you are the only person working on a project, it’s simple: you will export a final project timeline that includes information about each step of the project, each output, and the documentation needed to make those outputs useful. If you work with other people, STAPLE will allow you to assign tasks to those individuals (or teams of individuals) to complete as part of the project management functionality. At the same time, STAPLE tracks their work and creates a project timeline that shows that they completed a task for the project.\nThis component of the software was designed to align with contributorship models of research - instead of “authorship”, each person receives credit for the components they contributed to the project (Allen et al., 2014, 2019). Each field has different standards for authorship, and many individual’s work may not be acknowledged due to those cultures. Using STAPLE, their work would be credited, even if they did not earn final “authorship” on a publication. This output is also useful for defining contributions into systems such as CRediT - where each person’s role is binned into categories. By linking each role to specific tasks, we can transparently show what each role means to a specific project.\n\n\n\n\nAdan, C. (2023). The importance of diversity in clinical research.

    "text": "3.2 Why should I create metadata?\nThe purpose of metadata within the scientific community is multi-fold and often described with the acronym FAIR (Wilkinson et al., 2016):\n\nFindable: allowing resources to be findable via database, search engine, etc. Metadata is indexed by journals, libraries, databases, and search engines to assist in discovery.\nAccessible: allowing resources to be accessible by providing information on how to download/use resources\n\nInteroperable: the ability to integrate resources with other resources\nReusable: enough information should be provided that resources can be reused by other individuals.\n\nLearn more about FAIR principles here: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\nMetadata can be time consuming, confusing, and hard to make. So, why should you create metadata that makes your work FAIR?\n\nIt can be required:\n\nRecent laws across the globe require at least open data to be provided with publications or research reports.\nJournals have begun to adopt the Transparency and Openness Guidelines (https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines), which requires the sharing of resources for a project. For stricter TOP guidelines, metadata would be required to adhere to those standards.\n\nReproducibility:\n\nResearchers can independently verify your work and correct errors if found (Piwowar & Vision, 2013).\n\nExtension/Generalization:\n\nResearchers can extend your work by using resources in new projects, reanalyzing data in new ways, or combining resources for meta-analysis (Vadillo, Gold, & Osman, 2018; the Human Connectome Project—Van Essen et al., 2013).\n\nVisibility and Metrics:\n\nPublications with open resources have higher citation rates (McKiernan et al., 2016).s",

    "section": "3.3 How metadata is structured",
    "text": "3.3 How metadata is structured\nMetadata can fall into two categories:\n\nHuman readable: human readable formats are structured as a report with titles of metadata information and the description for each provided.\nExamples of human-readable formats:\n\nDescriptive reports\nSimple tables provided resources and their descriptions\n\nMachine readable: provides the same information as the human readable format, but in a structured/standardized format that can be integrated and read by computer systems.\n\nExamples of machine-readable formats:\n\nBar codes\neXtensible Markup Language (XML)\nJavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\nResource Description Framework (RDF)\n\n\n\nIn STAPLE, we allow you to create metadata through simple HTML forms that conforms to either our proposed minimum standard or your own uploaded standard. If you have never worked with metadata or created it before, you can use our templates to understand what needs to be provided and when. If your research field has existing standards, you can use STAPLE to ensure you include the required information.\nWe will describe our minimum metadata standards below and provide examples JSON or JSON-LD format. JSON is one of most popular machine readable formats because it is “lightweight” as a simple text file of key-value pairs. It resembles a dictionary where each entry has a name and a description.\nFor example, here’s how you might format author information:\n{\n  \"author\":[\n    {\"firstName\":\"Erin\", \"lastName\":\"Buchanan\"},\n    {\"firstName\":\"Marton\", \"lastName\":\"Kovacs\"},\n    {\"firstName\":\"Engerst\", \"lastName\":\"Yedra\"}\n  ]\n}\nThe author metadata includes three entries, which have more metadata: first and last names. Generally, metadata is hierarchical or nested to show the relationship between items (i.e., authors have first and last names). We will create output from STAPLE in JSON-Linked Data (JSON-LD) format which was created by the Resource Descriptive Framework (RDF Core Working Group, 2004). The LD formatting adds special pieces of information @context and @type - denoting the specific metadata style you are using and typology of the information you are sharing. This standardization of metadata allows for indexing in databases and search engines (especially https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/).\nHere’s an example of the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007):\n{\n  \"@context\": [\"https://schema.org/\"],\n  \"@type\": [\"Dataset\"],\n  \"name\": [\"The English Lexicon Project\"],\n  \"fileFormat\": [\".csv\"],\n  \"contentUrl\": [\"https://elexicon.wustl.edu/index.html\"]\n}\nSTAPLE generally uses schema.org naming conventions for our minimum metadata standards. Schema.org is a collaborative working group that has provided a standardization for metadata vocabulary. For example, the author of this documentation may be formatted as:\n{ \n  \"author\":[    \n    {\n      \"@type\":[\"Person\"],\n      \"identifier\":[\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9689-4189\"],\n      \"givenName\":[\"Erin\"],\n      \"familyName\":[\"Buchanan\"],\n      \"email\":[\"ebuchanan@harrisburgu.edu\"],\n      \"affiliation\":[\"Harrisburg University of Science and Technology\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\nMany communities use Schema.org and extend their formats for their own individual needs. See for example:\n\nBioschemas for the lifesciences (https://bioschemas.org/)\nBrain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS; Gorgolewski et al., 2016; https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendices/schema.html) for brain imaging data\npsych-DS (Kline, 2018) for the psychology community\nFinance and business (https://www.w3.org/community/fibo/)\nAutomotive industry (http://www.automotive-ontology.org/)\n\nThe advantage to using Schema.org is it’s popularity - many people use it and computers know how to read it. Further, it is considered semantic which details the connections between items (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web).",

    "text": "3.4 STAPLE Metadata\nBelow, we explore the types of metadata that are available in STAPLE and their minimum requirements. Each of these requirements can be extended (see building your own metadata [LINK]), developed from scratch, or other community requirements can be imported into STAPLE (see converting metadata into STAPLE format [LINK]).\nYou can view our JSON validation schema by examining each file LINK. JSON validation schema are used to create the forms you see in the app and to ensure that the output files are formatted correctly.\nYou can view our JSON-LD examples of the output from each schema LINK. These files would be downloaded from STAPLE to share in a repository like GitHub or the Open Science Framework.\nThe image below shows how each type of metadata collected within STAPLE for our minimum standard is related to each other. Each piece is described below with the required components. Within the descriptions below, we denote the official keyword for a object and then the description of what that keyword indicates. These are taken from Schema.org. In the app, they are given more descriptive titles/names to know what to enter in the form.\nFor example:\n\nidentifier –&gt; “Funding number or other identifier:”\naddressLocality –&gt; “City name of the Organization’s Location:”\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"pics/metadata.jpg\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Project\nProjects are separate research endeavors that you want to create information for and track using STAPLE’s features. Projects can be as simple as a manuscript/report/document you want to share, grant applications, data collection, stimuli and translations, etc. Generally, we think of projects as work that will eventually be published, but this is not a necessary requirement.\nRequired elements of project-level metadata (you enter this information):\n\nname: Name of the project\ndescription: Project description\nkeywords: Keywords\ncitation: Citation (should probably break this down into parts)\n\nSuggested elements of project-level metadata (you enter this information):\n\nabstract: Abstract of the project, generally from the paper or more formal than the required description\nidentifier: Persistent identifier (DOI, ISSN, etc.)\npublisher: Publisher (should this be under citation)\n\nOther elements of project-level metadata (that are added automatically):\n\nContributors\nCorresponding Author\nFunders\nDate\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Action\nAction describes all of the tasks completed within STAPLE.

    "text": "4.1.1 User\nA user in STAPLE is a person who has an account and agreed to terms and conditions. Users can create all the elements described below on their own accounts and complete tasks as part of projects that were created an another person’s account.\nUsers have the ability to log in/log out, update their personal information (username, password, email, and profile information), and delete their account. Users also have the ability to add and manage contributors who are part of their projects. They can create teams for individual projects.\nNote: Deleting your account does not delete you from contributions tied to other projects. You will lose the ability to edit those contributions but you must have the administrator of that project delete you from that project if you wish.\n\n4.1.1.1 Project Admin\nA use can be a project administrator:\n\nBy default, those who “create” a project are a project administrator on that project. See the permissions section below for an explanation of what that means.\nAdditional project administrators can be added to individual projects.\n\n\n\n4.1.1.2 Contributor\n\nA user can also be added as a contributor on a project. Contributors have limited access to other projects, generally only able to complete tasks that have been assigned to them.\n\n\n\n4.1.1.3 Teams\n\nTeams are a special type of contributor for projects. Each user can be part of multiple teams within a project. Teams are used for tasks that involve a group of people who need to complete a goal. For example, a data collection team for a project with human subjects will need to complete an ethics application to cover their team for data collection. Therefore, each person gets credit for completing the ethics review, but only one person on the team needs to complete the “task” within STAPLE. Another example could be a team of translators who work on converting materials into Spanish from French. The goal is to provide the final Spanish materials, but the entire team gets credit for completing this task.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Permissions\n\nProject administrators have permissions to edit everything within a project (people, structure [see below], tasks, documentation, and more). They can add, edit, delete, and update all information within a project.\nContributors only have permission to view and edit tasks that are assigned to them, along with the global project information on a project to which they have been added.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Projects\n\n\nProjects are the main organizational structure within STAPLE. Projects are defined by the user but can be thought of as: a research paper, a thesis, a grant application, a meta-analysis, a team report, and more.\nUsers will be able to create, read, update, and delete projects. They can define project roles by adding contributors (and contributor teams) and defining additional project administrators. They can create, update, and delete all the possible options described below (elements, tasks, metadata).\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Tasks\n\nTasks are the “to-do” list within a project. Tasks must be assigned to a project. Each task must have a contributor and/or team assigned to them (and the default is the person who creates the task). Additionally, tasks can include a requirement for documentation. These documentation standards can be selected from our minimum requirement list or can your own options can be uploaded.\nThe documentation will appear as a “form” online for a person to fill out. They will fill in the required information for that type of task (defined by the creator, please see metadata section for types). These form outputs can be updated by the project administrator at any time or can be updated as part of the review process.\nOnce a task has been assigned to a user, the user will get an email to complete the task. At this point, once the user has “completed” the task, the project administrator will receive an email that the task has been completed. They can review the task to ensure it has been completed correctly. If not, they can send the task back to the original user who can then update the task information. This structure is designed in a similar way to GitHub - once a person completes as task, it is reviewed. If ok, the task is marked done, and if not, it requires the original contributor to update and resubmit.\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Elements\n\nElements are a special placeholder within a project. You can create projects entirely without elements. However, many people like to group tasks into larger categories. Elements are storage boxes for groups of tasks or outputs that fit together. For example, you may create an element for a project that contains all the stimuli materials. This element could be assigned tasks such as “upload the stimuli online”, “translate the stimuli into French”, “translate the stimuli in Arabic”, and so on.\nYou can also use elements to label specific sections of a project. For example, you can use elements to hold materials, data, analyses, and the final manuscript, which will put these outputs into labeled sections on the final documentation.\nTasks can be assigned to elements. By assigning a task to an element, you are grouping them together on STAPLE and the final output documentation provided for transparency purposes.\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Dashboard\n\nThe project dashboard allows you to review the elements, tasks, contributors, and documentation available for the project.\nAdditionally, you can view and export a human and machine readable timeline for the project. This documentation will include the project documentation collected from contributors, the element structure of the project, and what each contributor did for the project (and a timestamp of when they did it).",

    "text": "5.1 Example 1: One Principal Investigator, Multiple Data Sources\nThe first example study covers a computational linguistics project in which a researcher collects primary data and uses a secondary data source. In this project, the researcher collects data on semantic priming to show that people read faster when the words are related to each other like cat-dog rather than unrelated like spoon-dog. Researchers can define similarity - how related words are - in multiple ways, so the researcher wishes to clearly document how they calculated similarity using an secondary data source. Further, the researcher used other psycholinguistic databases to see if they could predict the amount of semantic priming in their study based on the characteristics of the words in the study.",

    "text": "5.1.1 Add a Project\nFirst, you will go to the project page by using the top navigation bar. To add a new project, click “CREATE PROJECT”.\nEnter your project name and description.\nTo do: add all project level metadata.\nOnce the project page is created, you will be brought to the overview page for the project.\nTo do: the data dashboard is temporary, ideas welcome.\nEach component of the project dashboard is explained more on STAPLE Elements section. In short:\n\nTasks: a place to create to-dos, track contributions, and add reminders to get things done. Tasks are always tied to projects and a specific user or team.\nElements: elements are storage boxes for specific project steps. You can think of them as ways to organize your tasks or project. For example, you may use Ethics, Data, Analysis and Results, and Manuscript as ways to group tasks, contributions, and outputs together. Tasks can be tied to a specific element.\nContributors: people involved in the project. This part does not necessarily mean authorship, it simply means someone who did something for the project.\nSettings: the place to update the project level metadata.\n\nTo do: figure out how to add users and teams for different levels of project tasks.\n\n\n5.1.2 Add Elements\nI would then add the different elements to my project. I click on elements to get the elements page and create element for adding new areas of organization. There are lots of ways to organize these. I could have created “data” and put both primary and secondary data within that element. I also could add separate elements for the pre-registration (if applicable) or potentially separate materials and translation into two elements.\nTo do: figure out a view and updating for these.\n\n\n5.1.3 Add Contributors\nFrom the project dashboard, you can click on contributors to add a new person to the project. Note: this process adds them only to that project.\nYou would be able to add contributors by email on this page. It will notify them that you have added them to the project. Once a contributor has been added to a project, you can begin to assign them tasks.\nTo do:\n\nAllow adding by email.\nCreate teams and add contributors to them.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Add Tasks\nIn theory, you could create and run a project with no elements. You would use the task tab for all functionality. To create a task, click on tasks. Note that a lot of task functionality is not available yet, but we will pretend it is.\nWhen creating a task, you will define:\n\nThe task name\nThe task description or a how-to complete the task\nThe element a task should be assigned to (or none)\nThe person or team associated with the task\nIf the task needs an “output” (something that needs metadata)\nIf so, what type of metadata should the task include?\n\nOnce you create a task, the information on what needs to be done will be emailed to the user or team with the task information. They (or you) will be able to complete the task, and information about when the task was assigned and completed will be stored.\nIf the task has been tagged with needing an output - you will then need to enter the metadata for the requested output. For example, I created a task called “upload IRB documents”. In this case, the required output would be ethics approval for the study. I would store that document in my favorite repository (OSF, GitHub, FigShare, etc.) and create a permanent link for the document. Then I would enter the required metadata for that document. In this case, it would be a simple explanation of what the text document contains.\nTo do:\n\nAllow tasks to be tagged within element.\nView tasks within elements pages.\nAllow tasks to be tagged with a person or team.\nAllow tasks to be tagged with “needs metadata” or not.\nProvide example of difference in metadata for primary and secondary data.\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Project Outputs\nTo do: Add examples for each type of metadata here. Please see the Metadata section at the moment.\n\n\n5.1.6 Project Completion\nWhen all tasks are complete and all metadata is entered for the project outputs, you can build a project timeline from the dashboard page. This information will present:\n\nWhat was done on a project with a timestamp (example)\n\nWho/When a task was assigned\nWho/When a task was completed\nWho/When metadata was added\nWho/When elements were created\nAnd so on\n\nA machine readable format of all the metadata for the study\nA contributorship output matching the model you wish to use\n\nFor example, tagged CRediT categories\n\n\nTo do: update dashboard to include this option.",

Use the following (not the # line, these are notes) to install packages, tailwind, and daisyui.\n\n# to install all packages for staple\nnpm install\n# install tailwind css\nblitz install tailwind\n# install daisyui\nnpm i -D daisyui@latest\n\nNext, use the following line to create the database structure/schema for STAPLE to run.\n\n# to create database with the right set up\nblitz prisma generate\nblitz prisma migrate dev\n\n\n6.2.7 Starting the App - Local Testing\n\nIn a terminal window, go to the folder you cloned this repository and type:\n\nblitz dev\n\nOpen (usually) http://localhost:3000 (or whatever it says for localhost in the terminal) with your browser to see the result.\nThis step works great on a “regular” computer, but may not be useful for a server. Instead run the service “in production” to view on your website.\n\n\n\n6.2.8 Starting the App - Production\n\nIn a terminal window, go to the folder you cloned this repository and type:\n\nblitz build\n\nThis step may produce errors in the build. You will need to fix these errors before running the application. Check below for common issues.\n\n\n\n6.2.9 Keeping the App Going\n\nCreate a service.\nGenerally, you might consider putting it here: /etc/systemd/system/ on a linux machine.\nWe’ve named the file blitz.service as an example creating it using nano.\nTutorial for those who do not know how to do this - Installation Instructions\n\n# for example \nerin@staple:/var/www/html/STAPLE$ cd /etc/systemd/system/\nerin@staple:/etc/systemd/system$ nano blitz.service\n\nExample file structure:\nChange the WorkingDirectory to your folder.\n\n[Unit]\nDescription=Starts the Blitz service.\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nWorkingDirectory=/var/www/html/STAPLE\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/blitz start\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=default.target\n\nCommands:\n\nstop: sudo systemctl stop blitz\nstart: sudo systemctl start blitz\nrestart: sudo systemctl restart blitz\nreload: sudo systemctl reload blitz\ndisable: sudo systemctl disable blitz\nre-enable: sudo systemctl enable blitz\nstatus: sudo systemctl status blitz\nreset: sudo systemctl reset-failed blitz\n\n\nMany thanks to Scott B. for setting this up and giving instructions.\n\nRun sudo systemctl start blitz.\nCheck the status using sudo systemctl status blitz. Type the letter q to exit.\nStatus can also help you troubleshoot when you have an error.\n\n\n\n6.2.10 Setting Up the Proxy\n\nUse the following to get to the nginx web server: cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled\nCreate a file by using nano YOURWEBSITE … for example ours is nano app.staple.science because that is the website of our hosted version of STAPLE.\nCreate the server file setup:\n\n# Default server configuration\n#\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name app.staple.science;\n    error_log /var/www/html/YOURFOLDER/logs/web-server.log;\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;\n    }\n}\n\nFor https you need to set up a certificate and the easiest solution is through certbot. See Installation Instructions.\n\nsudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx",

Author order often signals who did the most work or led the project.\n\n\nContributor/Member\nAn individual who actively participates in a project. Contributors may take on different roles, responsibilities, and levels of access within STAPLE.\n\n\ncontributorship\nAn alternative to traditional authorship that provides a more transparent account of each person’s role in a research project. Instead of assigning credit through a fixed order of authors’ names, contributorship models (such as the CRediT taxonomy) specify the specific tasks and responsibilities undertaken by each contributor—for example, conceptualization, data curation, analysis, project administration, or writing. This approach aims to recognize diverse forms of scholarly labor, reduce disputes over author order, and promote accountability.\n\n\nCRediT\nA standardized system for describing the specific roles individuals play in research projects. CRediT defines 14 contributor roles—such as conceptualization, methodology, data curation, writing (original draft), and project administration—to provide a transparent account of who did what. Rather than replacing authorship, CRediT works alongside it to make contributions more visible and accountable, helping to reduce disputes and ensure proper recognition.\n\n\nFAIR\nFAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, a set of guiding principles that aim to improve the management and stewardship of scientific data, metadata, and other research outputs. Originally proposed by Wilkinson et al. (2016), the FAIR principles emphasize that data should be findable through rich metadata and persistent identifiers; accessible using standardized protocols, even when access is restricted; interoperable via the use of shared formats, vocabularies, and ontologies; and reusable by ensuring clear licensing, documentation, and provenance. FAIR is not a strict standard but a framework to guide the development of research practices and infrastructure that support transparency, reproducibility, and long-term reuse by both humans and machines.\n\n\nForms\nStructured templates for capturing important project metadata, such as study design details, instruments used, or ethical approvals, ensuring consistency and transparency.\n\n\nmetadata\nMetadata is information that describes other data. It helps explain what a dataset or research output is, how it was created, who created it, and how it can be used. Metadata makes data easier to find, understand, and reuse.\n\n\nMilestones\nMarkers of significant progress within a project, such as completing data collection or submitting a manuscript. Milestones help track timelines and achievements.\n\n\nProject\nA container for a scientific effort, capturing the overall scope, goals, timeline, and team. All other elements: tasks, contributors, metadata, and outputs are organized within a project.\n\n\nProject Summary\nAn automatically generated overview that consolidates key project information, including tasks, contributors, metadata, milestones, and outputs, into a shareable format.\n\n\nRoles\nDefined levels of access and responsibility within a project (e.g., project manager, editor, viewer). Roles help manage permissions and clarify responsibilities.\n\n\nTags\nFlexible labels used to categorize and filter tasks or projects. Tags help organize work by theme, method, priority, or custom criteria.\n\n\nTask\nA discrete unit of work within a project, such as designing a survey, analyzing data, or drafting a manuscript. Tasks can be assigned, tracked, and logged to monitor progress.\n\n\nTask Logs\nA chronological record of all activity on a task, including assignments, updates, completions, and notes. Task logs create a transparent history of project work, making it easier to track progress, maintain accountability, and reconstruct decisions.\n\n\nTeam\nThe group of contributors working together on a project. Teams may span labs, institutions, or disciplines, and are defined by shared access to project tasks and resources.\n\n\nTransparency and Openness\nA set of community-developed standards created to improve the transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility of research. The TOP Guidelines outline eight modular standards (e.g., data citation, data sharing, analytic methods, preregistration, replication) with different levels of stringency that journals, funders, and institutions can adopt to encourage open scientific practices.\n\n\nUser\nAny person with access to STAPLE. A user may belong to multiple projects and teams, with different roles in each.",

    "text": "3.1 STAPLE Elements\nResearch projects are made up of many moving parts: overarching goals, specific hypotheses, tasks to carry out, and the people who contribute along the way. To manage this complexity, STAPLE organizes projects into a small set of core elements. These elements provide a shared structure that scientists and collaborators can understand quickly, regardless of discipline.\nAt the highest level, a Project represents the scientific effort being undertaken: its aims, scope, and timeline. Within each project, researchers define Tasks, which capture the individual units of work needed to achieve those aims. Teams and Contributor/Members provide the human side of the system, reflecting roles, privileges, and collaborations across labs and institutions. Every action taken on a task, whether assigning it, updating its status, or marking it as complete, is recorded in Task Logs, creating a transparent history of progress. Finally, Tags allow projects to be categorized, searched, and documented in ways that make sense for science.\nTogether, these elements form the backbone of STAPLE, giving research teams a clear, consistent framework for planning and documenting their work.",

    "text": "3.2 Metadata\nIn scientific research, data alone is never enough, what makes data meaningful is the metadata that describes it. Metadata captures the critical context behind research activities: the methods used, the instruments applied, the variables measured, and the conditions under which data were collected. Without metadata, results can be difficult to reproduce, interpret, or build upon.\nSTAPLE treats metadata as a first-class feature, not an afterthought. The software also automatically records who did what, and when, embedding provenance metadata directly within projects. Project information, such as data, materials, and analysis code, can be linked within STAPLE and enriched with metadata. These details are captured using the Forms feature, which provides structured templates tailored to research needs. Completion of metadata can be assigned to contributors via Tasks, making documentation part of the normal project workflow rather than an extra burden.\nBy embedding metadata capture directly into everyday research activities, STAPLE makes it easier for scientists to document their work transparently, meet the expectations of journals and funders, and create records that future collaborators, or even their own future selves, can interpret and reuse. All metadata can be exported as machine-readable JSON for computational use and as human-readable interactive Project Summary reports for sharing and communication.",

You will lose editing access, but only a project administrator can fully remove you from their project.\n\n3.3.1.1 Project Administrator\n\nThe user who creates a project is automatically assigned as its project administrator.\nAdditional administrators can be added to a project as needed.\nEvery project must have at least one administrator at all times.\nAdministrators have the highest level of control, including managing contributors, editing project settings, and assigning roles.\n\n\n\n3.3.1.2 Contributor\n\nA contributor is a user added to a project by an administrator.\nContributors generally have limited access: they can view project information and complete tasks assigned to them but cannot change project settings or manage other users.\nThis role allows project teams to include collaborators without granting full administrative privileges.\n\n\n\n3.3.1.3 Teams\n\nTeams are a special type of contributor within a project.\nA user can belong to multiple teams in the same project.\nTeams are useful when a task requires collaboration by a group rather than an individual.\n\nFor example, a data collection team working with human participants may need to complete an ethics application. Only one person needs to submit the form within STAPLE, but the entire team receives credit for completing the task. Similarly, a translation team might be responsible for converting study materials from French into Spanish. The collective goal is to provide the final Spanish materials, but all members of the team are credited for the work.\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Main and Project Level Options\n\n3.3.2.1 Dashboard\nThe Dashboard is your personalized home page in STAPLE. It provides a high-level overview of all the projects you’re involved in, along with recent updates and tasks assigned to you. From here, you can quickly jump into active projects, track progress at a glance, and see what needs your attention today. Think of it as your command center for research project management.\nIn addition to this main dashboard, each project also has its own Project Dashboard. While the main dashboard gives you a cross-project snapshot, the project dashboard focuses on the details of a single project, its contributors, tasks, metadata, milestones, and outputs. Together, the two levels of dashboards help you move easily between the big picture and the project-specific details.\n\n\n3.3.2.2 Projects\nProjects are the central containers for scientific work. Each project includes its own tasks, teams, metadata, and outputs. On the Projects page, you can:\n\nCreate a new project.\nView and manage existing projects.\nGo into the project level dashboard.\n\nProjects provide the big-picture structure that keeps research activities organized and transparent.\n\n\n3.3.2.3 Invitations\nInvitations are how collaborators join projects in STAPLE. Project administrators send invitations that specify the role a user will have once they accept.\n\nOn the main dashboard, you can view all of your pending invitations across projects and choose to accept or decline them.\nOn a project dashboard, only project administrators can see the invitations they have sent for that specific project.\n\nA contributor cannot be assigned tasks or added to teams until they have accepted their invitation. This system ensures that every collaborator’s involvement is explicit, documented, and consented to before work begins.\n\n\n3.3.2.4 Tasks\nTasks break a project down into actionable steps and are the backbone of daily research activity in STAPLE.\n\nOn the main dashboard, the Tasks page shows a consolidated view of all tasks assigned to you across every project, so nothing slips through the cracks.\nOn a project dashboard, project administrators can view and manage all tasks within that project, while contributors see only the tasks assigned to them.\n\nWithin a project, you can:\n\nCreate new tasks for yourself or others.\nAssign tasks to contributors or teams.\nUpdate task status (to-do, in progress, complete).\nAdd labels, metadata, and logs to track progress.\n\nThis two-level view ensures that contributors can stay focused on their own responsibilities while project managers maintain oversight of the entire project’s workflow.\n\n\n3.3.2.5 Notifications\nNotifications keep you informed about project activity without needing to check each page manually. These alerts let you know when:\n\nYou’ve been assigned a new task.\nA task you’re involved in has been updated, completed, or approved.\nYou’ve received a project invitation.\n\nOn the main dashboard, notifications show updates from all of your projects in one place. On a project dashboard, notifications are filtered to that project only, helping you focus on what matters most in the current context. The Notifications page ensures you never miss important updates in collaborative projects.\n\n\n3.3.2.6 Forms\nForms are structured templates for collecting metadata at the project or task level. They make sure essential details, such as ethics approvals, instrument calibration, dataset versions, or preregistration links, are captured consistently.\nSTAPLE includes a library of form templates, giving you a starting point if you’re not sure what metadata to collect. You can also design your own forms tailored to your project’s needs. Forms must be created before they can be used in a project, ensuring that the structure is in place before contributors start filling them out.\nOnce in use, forms become a powerful way to collect metadata directly within your workflow. You can:\n\nFill out forms as part of project tasks.\nAssign forms to contributors or teams to ensure documentation responsibilities are shared.\nReuse templates across multiple projects for consistency.\n\nBy embedding metadata capture directly into the research process, forms help projects meet transparency and reproducibility standards while reducing the burden of after-the-fact documentation.\n\n\n3.3.2.7 Roles\nRoles in STAPLE describe the kinds of contributions people make within a project. While they draw inspiration from frameworks like the CRediT taxonomy, they are not limited to authorship or publication contexts. Instead, roles provide a flexible way to document responsibilities and ensure that contributions are visible across the lifespan of a project.\nIn STAPLE, roles can be:\n\nAssigned to people → to show what responsibilities each contributor holds in a project.\nAssigned to tasks → to clarify what kind of contribution a task represents and how it fits into the project.\n\nRoles provide a flexible system for understanding who did what and for standardizing contributions across projects. Role templates are avaliable to add to your account, which you can use across all projects. They must be created on the main dashboard before you can use them.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Project Level Options\n\n3.3.3.1 Tags\nTags are flexible labels that help organize and filter milestones, tasks, and contributors. Tags make it easier to search and group related work across large projects. You can view customized tracking by using tags across these parts of the project.\n\n\n3.3.3.2 Milestones\nMilestones mark major points of progress within a project and help teams track deadlines and achievements. In STAPLE, milestones can also group related tasks together, providing a clear structure for managing phases of a project. Each milestone is tied to a timeline, and STAPLE automatically visualizes them in a Gantt chart, making it easier to see how tasks and deadlines align. This helps teams monitor progress, anticipate bottlenecks, and keep projects moving forward on schedule.\n\n\n3.3.3.3 Notes\nNotes provide a space for free-text documentation within a project. Unlike structured metadata captured through Forms, Notes allow contributors to record context, reminders, or reflections in their own words.\nNotes can be:\n\nPrivate – visible only to the author.\nShared with contributors – if shared by a project administrator, contributors can view them.\nRestricted to administrators – for communication only among project managers.\n\nThis flexibility makes Notes useful for everything from personal reminders to collaborative discussions among administrators.\n\n\n3.3.3.4 Form Data\nForm Data is the collected information from metadata Forms within a project. It provides a centralized view of all structured metadata entries—such as instrument details, ethics protocols, or dataset versions—that have been completed by contributors. Form Data can be reviewed, exported, and updated if errors have occurred.\n\n\n3.3.3.5 Summary\nThe Summary page generates a shareable overview of the project. It consolidates contributors, tasks, roles, metadata, milestones, and outputs into one report. Project Summaries can be exported in both machine-readable formats (JSON) and human-readable interactive reports, making them useful for collaboration, archiving, and compliance with funder or journal requirements.\n\n\n3.3.3.6 Settings\nThe Settings page allows administrators to configure project-level metadata. This includes details such as the project title, description, timeline, and high-level information about the project’s scope.",

    "section": "4.3 Installation Steps",
    "text": "4.3 Installation Steps\n\n4.3.1 Web Server Installation\nSTAPLE requires a web server to handle requests. You can choose between Apache or Nginx:\n\nApache – Installation Instructions\nNginx – Installation Instructions\n\n\n⚠️ Important: Only install one. Apache and Nginx don’t play nicely together if they’re both running on the same server.\n\nWe recommend using Nginx, and our production server is configured with Nginx. This step is only required for people who want to host the software online. You do not need it for local development or use.\n\n\n4.3.2 Blitz/JS Installation\nSTAPLE is built with Blitz.js, which runs on Node.js. To install the required tools:\n\nInstall Node.js and npm\n\nFollow the official installation instructions: Node.js Downloads\nRequired versions:\n\nNode.js: v18+\nnpm: v9+\n\nVerify installation with:\n\n\nnode -v\nnpm -v\n\n(Optional) Yarn: You may use Yarn if you prefer, but this guide assumes npm.\nInstall Blitz.js\n\nRun:\n\n\nnpm install -g blitz\n\nVerify installation (version v2+ required):\n\nblitz -v\n\nℹ️ Note: Depending on your server setup, you may need to prepend commands with sudo.\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Clone the Repository\nNext, you’ll need to copy the STAPLE source code onto your server.\n\nInstall Git (if not already installed):\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git\n\nNavigate to your web directory (commonly /var/www/html/ or /var/www/):\nNote: you can use any folder on your computer if you are not hosting the software online or want to do local development.\n\ncd /var/www/html/\n\nClone the repository:\n\nFollow the GitHub guide on cloning repositories.\n\nOr simply run:\n\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/STAPLE-verse/STAPLE.git\n\nThis will create a new folder named STAPLE containing all the files you need.\nMove into the project folder:\n\ncd STAPLE\n\n\n4.3.4 Database Installation\nSTAPLE requires a PostgreSQL database.\n\nInstall PostgreSQL\n\nEnsure that you have a local PostgreSQL service running.\nFollow this guide for installation: Postgres Setup Instructions.\nDuring installation:\n\nWrite down the superuser credentials (important on non-Linux systems).\nOther databases may work, but you would need to modify the STAPLE codebase to support them.\n\n\nCreate Databases\n\nOpen a terminal and run:\n\n\n# Switch into PostgreSQL as the postgres superuser\nsudo -u postgres psql\n\n# Create databases for STAPLE\nCREATE DATABASE staple;\nCREATE DATABASE staple_test;\n\nCreate a User\n\nIt’s best not to use the default postgres user for STAPLE. Instead, create a new user:\nReplace username and password with your desired values (keep the quotes).\n\n\nCREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'password';\nALTER ROLE username CREATEDB;\n\nCheck Databases\n\nInside the PostgreSQL prompt, you can verify:\n\n\n\\l   -- lists databases\n\\c staple   -- connect to the STAPLE database\n\\dn  -- lists schemas\n\nYou should see something like the following using those commands:\n\npostgres=# \\c staple\nYou are now connected to database \"staple\" as user \"postgres\".\nstaple=# \nstaple=# \\dn\n List of schemas\n  Name  | Owner  \n--------+--------\n public | staple\n(1 row)\n\nstaple=# \npostgres=# \\l\n                                     List of databases\n    Name     |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |     Access privileges     \n-------------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+---------------------------\n postgres    | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | \n staple      | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =Tc/postgres             +\n             |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres    +\n             |          |          |             |             | staple=CTc/postgres      +\n             |          |          |             |             | staple_admin=CTc/postgres\n staple_test | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | \n template0   | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres              +\n             |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres\n template1   | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres              +\n             |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres\n(5 rows)\n\nGrant Privileges\n\nFinally, grant permissions for your new user to manage the staple schema:\n\n\nGRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO username;\n\nExit PostgreSQL using \\q\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Connect Database to STAPLE App\n\nNow we’ll connect the PostgreSQL database you created to the STAPLE application.\nNavigate to your STAPLE project folder\n\ncd /var/www/html/STAPLE\nls -al\n\nYou should see a file named .env along with other project files.\nYou may need to enable hidden files to see .env files.\nExample:\n\nerin@staple:/var/www/html/STAPLE$ ls -al\ntotal 764\ndrwxr-xr-x  13 root root   4096 Oct 24 06:17 .\ndrwxr-xr-x   6 root root   4096 Oct 24 05:02 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root root   4096 Oct 24 04:27 db\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root    175 Oct 24 04:27 .editorconfig\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root    494 Oct 24 06:17 .env\n\nCreate a local environment file\n\nCopy the .env file and rename it to .env.local:\n\n\ncp .env .env.local\n- Open it for editing:\nnano .env.local\n\nAdd required environment variables\n\nAt minimum, your .env.local file needs these:\n\n\n# This env file should NOT be checked into source control\n# Use this file for local overrides\n\n# Replace username:password with your Postgres user and password\nDATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/staple\n\n# Generate a random session key\nSESSION_SECRET_KEY=your_generated_session_key\n\n# Where the app will live\nAPP_ORIGIN=\"http://localhost:3000/\"\n\nTo generate a SESSION_SECRET_KEY:\n\nCopy the output and paste it in place of your_generated_session_key.\n\n\nopenssl rand -hex 16\n\nSet up a test environment\n\nCopy .env.test to .env.test.local:\n\n\ncp .env.test .env.test.local\n\nEdit it to point to your test database:\n\nDATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/staple_test\n\n\n4.3.6 Configure Email\nSTAPLE requires an email provider to send system emails (e.g., password resets, project invitations). You can use other options here, but we’ve configured three of them in our current code.\n\n4.3.6.1 Secret Keys\n\nYou must configure at least one of the following options:\nGmail (App Passwords)\n\nCreate a Gmail App Password: Google Guide\nAdd to .env.local:\n\n\nEMAIL_PASS=\"your_app_password\"\n\nAmazon SES\n\nSet up Amazon Simple Email Service (SES): Amazon SES Docs\nAdd to .env.local:\n\n\nACCESS_KEY=\"amazonACCESS\"\nSECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\"amazonSECRET\"\n\nResend\n\nGet an API key from Resend.\nAdd to .env.local:\n\n\nRESEND_API_KEY=\"resendAPI\"\n\n\n4.3.6.2 Edit the Mailer Configuration\nIn addition to adding one of the above environment variables, you’ll need to edit the mailer configuration file so STAPLE knows which provider to use.\n\nOpen the mailer configuration file:\n\nnano integrations/mailer.js\n\nDelete non-used mailers: there are three chunks of code in this file - one for each type of email. You should delete the types you are not using to ensure the app runs. You can also insert your own mail options in this section.\nEdit the forgot password mailer:\n\nnano mailers/forgotPasswordMailer.ts\n\nChange these sections to the mailer you want to use:\n\n// import { Mailer } from \"integrations/mailer\"\nimport { createForgotPasswordMsg } from \"integrations/emails\"\n// import { Amazon } from \"integrations/mailer\"\nimport { ResendMsg } from \"integrations/mailer\"\n//send the email\nawait ResendMsg(createForgotPasswordMsg(to, resetUrl))\n// await Amazon(createForgotPasswordMsg(to, resetUrl)) # or amazon\n// await Mailer(createForgotPasswordMsg(to, resetUrl)) # or gmail\n\nEdit the emails.tsx file if you want to customize the emails that are sent with your own email address and logos.\n\nnano integrations/emails.tsx\n\n\n\n4.3.7 Install STAPLE Requirements\n\nMake sure you are in the STAPLE main folder before running these commands.\nUse the following (not the # line, these are notes) to install packages, tailwind, and daisyui.\n\n# Install all project dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Install Tailwind CSS\nblitz install tailwind\n\n# Install DaisyUI\nnpm i -D daisyui@latest\n\nSet up the database schema:\n\n# Generate Prisma client\nblitz prisma generate\n\n# Run migrations to create database structure\nblitz prisma migrate dev\n\n\n4.3.8 Starting the App - Local Testing\n\nOpen a terminal window and navigate to the STAPLE folder you cloned:\n\ncd /var/www/html/STAPLE\n\nStart the development server:\n\nblitz dev\n\nOnce the server is running, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000 (or whatever address is shown in your terminal output).\n\n\n\n4.3.9 Starting the App - Production\n\nOpen a terminal window and navigate to the STAPLE folder you cloned:\n\ncd /var/www/html/STAPLE\n\nBuild the application:\n\nblitz build\n\n⚠️ Note: If the build process produces errors, you’ll need to fix these before you can continue. Common issues include missing dependencies or mismatched Prisma client versions. Check the terminal output for details. We do not update our dev or main branches without fixing these, but it may be that your edits for your server caused hiccups.\n\n\nOnce the build completes successfully, start the app in production mode:\n\nblitz start\n\n\n4.3.10 Keeping the App Going\nWhen running in production, you’ll want STAPLE to automatically restart after crashes or reboots. The recommended way to do this on Linux is by creating a systemd service.\n\nCreate a service file\n\nNavigate to the systemd directory and create a new file (we’ll call it blitz.service):\n\n\ncd /etc/systemd/system/\nsudo nano blitz.service\n\nExample service file:\n\nReplace WorkingDirectory with the path to your STAPLE installation.\nYou can also set specific users or production modes for security.\n\n\n[Unit]\nDescription=Starts the Blitz service.\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nWorkingDirectory=/var/www/html/STAPLE\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/blitz start\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=default.target\n\nEnable and control the service\n\nOnce your file is saved, you can manage it with:\n\n\n# Start the service\nsudo systemctl start blitz  \n\n# Check status (press \"q\" to quit)\nsudo systemctl status blitz  \n\n# Restart the service\nsudo systemctl restart blitz  \n\n# Stop the service\nsudo systemctl stop blitz  \n\n# Enable service on boot\nsudo systemctl enable blitz  \n\n# Disable service\nsudo systemctl disable blitz  \n\n# Reset if failed\nsudo systemctl reset-failed blitz  \n\nTutorial reference\n\nIf you’re new to systemd services, see this helpful guide: Service Installation Instructions\n\n\n\n\n4.3.11 Setting Up the Proxy (Nginx)\nNow that STAPLE is running as a background service, you’ll want to expose it through your web domain with Nginx.\n\nNavigate to your Nginx configuration folder\n\ncd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled\n\nCreate a new site config file\n\nName it after your site, e.g.:\n\n\nsudo nano app.staple.science\n\nAdd the server configuration\n\nReplace app.staple.science with your domain and update the log path if needed:\n\n\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name app.staple.science;\n\n    error_log /var/www/html/YOURFOLDER/logs/web-server.log;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\n    }\n}\n\n⚠️ Important: Make sure the server_name matches your domain name, and the proxy_pass points to the port where Blitz is running (localhost:3000 by default).\n\n\nTest your config:\n\nsudo nginx -t\n\nIf you see syntax is ok and test is successful, reload Nginx:\n\nsudo systemctl reload nginx\n\n\n4.3.12 Enable HTTPS\n\nUse Let’s Encrypt to add SSL by changing the location of your app in the following:\n\nsudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx\nsudo certbot --nginx -d app.staple.science\n\nThis will automatically configure HTTPS and renew your certificate.\nSee Installation Instructions.",
