    "text": "1 Preface\nScientific research has become increasingly complex, requiring specialized skills, interdisciplinary work, and collaboration among large teams. Managing such projects and tracking data and metadata has become a significant challenge. The need for FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable Wilkinson et al. 2016) open data, materials, and metadata has similarly grown, especially considering recent mandates for required sharing for federally funded projects (Rep. Ryan 2019; Rep. Foxx 2019). While user-friendly software tools that help researchers structure metadata exist, few researchers are aware of their necessity and usefulness, the onus is still on the project team to collect and curate this information. Studies using teams of researchers require sophisticated tracking of all project elements, and therefore, there is a need for scientific project management software that is tailored to the management of all manner of science projects. Software that promotes best practices in FAIR data and metadata would increase openness in all reporting, and tracking, and reporting standards.\nCurrently, the tools and websites designed for researchers are focused on getting researchers to share their materials, code, and data (i.e., Open Science Framework, FigShare, Zenodo. These repositories represent a necessary resource for long-term storage of outputs, but do not help researchers organize or track information during the life of a study. Project management software, like Asana, Monday, or ClickUp, are designed from a business perspective that is not tailored to scientific research. While the features that scientific research requires may be found in some individual project management software, no current solution provides all the essential features, such as the ability to assign tasks at different scales (e.g., teams, individuals), integrated metadata, fully transparent access to all information in the project manager, and long-term storage that complies with international data privacy regulations. Project management software is designed to get things done rather than document the way a project was completed, so attempts to use existing software for this often involve ‘hacking’ it to extract necessary records.\nTo this end, we developed STAPLE, which not only helps with the unique challenges of project management of research but includes open and transparent documentation of data and metadata, as well as providing templates for minimum metadata collection. STAPLE allows users to add project components based on research type, assign timelines, delegate tasks to individuals or groups, and link to long-term storage of research outputs. STAPLE helps track authorship credit and contributor roles via tasks or contributors. STAPLE includes default metadata standards for documenting common research outputs and is fully open-source, enabling community input and adaptation. Designed for global reach, STAPLE supports the transition to open science by including researchers and outputs that are often overlooked, regardless of technical expertise. Through its point-and-click interface, and downloadable documentation outputs, STAPLE makes it easier for all researchers to participate in transparent, inclusive, and reproducible science.\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndefinition\n\n\n\n\nFAIR\nFAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, a set of guiding principles that aim to improve the management and stewardship of scientific data, metadata, and other research outputs. Originally proposed by Wilkinson et al. (2016), the FAIR principles emphasize that data should be findable through rich metadata and persistent identifiers; accessible using standardized protocols, even when access is restricted; interoperable via the use of shared formats, vocabularies, and ontologies; and reusable by ensuring clear licensing, documentation, and provenance. FAIR is not a strict standard but a framework to guide the development of research practices and infrastructure that support transparency, reproducibility, and long-term reuse by both humans and machines.\n\n\nmetadata\nMetadata is information that describes other data. It helps explain what a dataset or research output is, how it was created, who created it, and how it can be used. Metadata makes data easier to find, understand, and reuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRep.

    "text": "The STAPLE mission: Project Management software that allows you to document your research project to improve transparency.\nAs researchers, we need to focus on the big picture - the overarching goals of a project, timelines, theory, hypotheses, and more. We then need to understand the smaller goals and tasks necessary to achieve the big picture. Researchers are often taught how to run projects, collect data, analyze that data, and write a paper summary. Training in project management is learned by example through the research lab, depending on the supervisor, and often not directly taught. Each project often involves special needs and circumstances, and the addition of even one more local collaborator can create complexity with multiple moving parts.\nResearch shows that the number of co-authors and collaborators on research projects is increasing over time. The globalization of research, the Internet, and software tools for collaboration (Zoom, GitHub, Google, etc.) has improved our ability to work together on new ideas. Large-scale collaboration has been encouraged to improve the diversity of participants, researchers, and cultures represented in data. Once we add other people (with different lab cultures and expectations!), institutions, geopolitical regions, and languages - the complexity of a research project also increases.\nSo why do we need software?\nProject management software exists: Asana, Monday, Clickup, and Trello for example. These products were designs based on project management templates that are often business focuses. Research projects have their own unique and special needs that do not fit neatly into business models. Large-scale teams have found success treating a research project with many smaller teams as a classroom - but software designed for educational purposes is also not completely compatible with research project goals and management. STAPLE is designed for scientists by scientists with input from important stakeholders including funders, librarians, journals, and more.\nSo what’s the deal with documentation?\nIn tandem with the encouragement for interdisciplinary, diverse teams, researchers have begun to focus on the improvement of science through transparency and sharing. The Transparency and Openness guidelines (https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines) establish ideals for projects to be reproducible, open, and transparency through data sharing, code/analysis sharing, materials sharing, pre-registration, and replication. Journals require different levels of sharing for publication, which has pushed researchers to begin to implement these practices. However, the simple sharing of data, code, and materials does not make them FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Simple sharing of data does not necessarily allow someone to find that data in relation to the research project, or allow a researcher to know what V1 means in the data, or even reuse part of the data.\nCreating adequate documentation for the reuse of any output from a project can be difficult. There are often no clear standards, the work can be time consuming, and is often left to the end of a project when important details may have been forgotten. STAPLE is designed to encourage you to document information along the way and to provide guidance with what you should include with each document. As you complete specific task, such as create your materials for a study, you will be able to link your project to those materials and include information to interpret and understand those documents. We provide a set of minimum documentation standards for multiple types of documents - and the ability for you to include extra information if your field has set standards.\nOk, so that’s transparent?\nSTAPLE allows you to track and run your project - and then include research outputs from that project. Each step of the way, STAPLE collects data about who did what and when. If you are the only person working on a project, it’s simple: you will export a final project timeline that includes information about each step of the project, each output, and the documentation needed to make those outputs useful. If you work with other people, STAPLE will allow you to assign tasks to those individuals (or teams of individuals!) to complete as part of the project management functionality. At the same time, STAPLE tracks their work and creates a project timeline that shows that they completed a task for the project.\nThis component of the software was designed to align with contributorship models of research - instead of “authorship”, each person receives credit for the components they contributed to the project. Each field has different standards for authorship, and many individual’s work may be unacknowledge due to those cultures. Using STAPLE, their work would be credited, even if they did not earn final “authorship” on a publication. This output is also useful for defining contributions into systems such as CRediT (https://credit.niso.org/) - where each person’s role is binned into categories. By linking each role to specific tasks, we can transparently show what each role means to a specific project.",

Most obvious resources from scientific projects include datasets from which analyses and research reports are derived. However, there are many types of resources that can be shared from a project.

    "text": "3.2 Why should I create metadata?\nThe purpose of metadata within the scientific community is multi-fold and often described with the acronym FAIR (Wilkinson et al., 2016):\n\nFindable: allowing resources to be findable via database, search engine, etc. Metadata is indexed by journals, libraries, databases, and search engines to assist in discovery.\nAccessible: allowing resources to be accessible by providing information on how to download/use resources\n\nInteroperable: the ability to integrate resources with other resources\nReusable: enough information should be provided that resources can be reused by other individuals.\n\nLearn more about FAIR principles here: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\nMetadata can be time consuming, confusing, and hard to make. So, why should you create metadata that makes your work FAIR?\n\nIt can be required:\n\nRecent laws across the globe require at least open data to be provided with publications or research reports.\nJournals have begun to adopt the Transparency and Openness Guidelines (https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines), which requires the sharing of resources for a project. For stricter TOP guidelines, metadata would be required to adhere to those standards.\n\nReproducibility:\n\nResearchers can independently verify your work and correct errors if found (Piwowar & Vision, 2013).\n\nExtension/Generalization:\n\nResearchers can extend your work by using resources in new projects, reanalyzing data in new ways, or combining resources for meta-analysis (Vadillo, Gold, & Osman, 2018; the Human Connectome Project—Van Essen et al., 2013).\n\nVisibility and Metrics:\n\nPublications with open resources have higher citation rates (McKiernan et al., 2016).s",

    "section": "3.3 How metadata is structured",
    "text": "3.3 How metadata is structured\nMetadata can fall into two categories:\n\nHuman readable: human readable formats are structured as a report with titles of metadata information and the description for each provided.\nExamples of human-readable formats:\n\nDescriptive reports\nSimple tables provided resources and their descriptions\n\nMachine readable: provides the same information as the human readable format, but in a structured/standardized format that can be integrated and read by computer systems.\n\nExamples of machine-readable formats:\n\nBar codes\neXtensible Markup Language (XML)\nJavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\nResource Description Framework (RDF)\n\n\n\nIn STAPLE, we allow you to create metadata through simple HTML forms that conforms to either our proposed minimum standard or your own uploaded standard. If you have never worked with metadata or created it before, you can use our templates to understand what needs to be provided and when. If your research field has existing standards, you can use STAPLE to ensure you include the required information.\nWe will describe our minimum metadata standards below and provide examples JSON or JSON-LD format. JSON is one of most popular machine readable formats because it is “lightweight” as a simple text file of key-value pairs. It resembles a dictionary where each entry has a name and a description.\nFor example, here’s how you might format author information:\n{\n  \"author\":[\n    {\"firstName\":\"Erin\", \"lastName\":\"Buchanan\"},\n    {\"firstName\":\"Marton\", \"lastName\":\"Kovacs\"},\n    {\"firstName\":\"Engerst\", \"lastName\":\"Yedra\"}\n  ]\n}\nThe author metadata includes three entries, which have more metadata: first and last names. Generally, metadata is hierarchical or nested to show the relationship between items (i.e., authors have first and last names). We will create output from STAPLE in JSON-Linked Data (JSON-LD) format which was created by the Resource Descriptive Framework (RDF Core Working Group, 2004). The LD formatting adds special pieces of information @context and @type - denoting the specific metadata style you are using and typology of the information you are sharing. This standardization of metadata allows for indexing in databases and search engines (especially https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/).\nHere’s an example of the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007):\n{\n  \"@context\": [\"https://schema.org/\"],\n  \"@type\": [\"Dataset\"],\n  \"name\": [\"The English Lexicon Project\"],\n  \"fileFormat\": [\".csv\"],\n  \"contentUrl\": [\"https://elexicon.wustl.edu/index.html\"]\n}\nSTAPLE generally uses schema.org naming conventions for our minimum metadata standards. Schema.org is a collaborative working group that has provided a standardization for metadata vocabulary. For example, the author of this documentation may be formatted as:\n{ \n  \"author\":[    \n    {\n      \"@type\":[\"Person\"],\n      \"identifier\":[\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9689-4189\"],\n      \"givenName\":[\"Erin\"],\n      \"familyName\":[\"Buchanan\"],\n      \"email\":[\"ebuchanan@harrisburgu.edu\"],\n      \"affiliation\":[\"Harrisburg University of Science and Technology\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\nMany communities use Schema.org and extend their formats for their own individual needs. See for example:\n\nBioschemas for the lifesciences (https://bioschemas.org/)\nBrain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS; Gorgolewski et al., 2016; https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendices/schema.html) for brain imaging data\npsych-DS (Kline, 2018) for the psychology community\nFinance and business (https://www.w3.org/community/fibo/)\nAutomotive industry (http://www.automotive-ontology.org/)\n\nThe advantage to using Schema.org is it’s popularity - many people use it and computers know how to read it. Further, it is considered semantic which details the connections between items (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web).",

    "text": "3.4 STAPLE Metadata\nBelow, we explore the types of metadata that are available in STAPLE and their minimum requirements. Each of these requirements can be extended (see building your own metadata [LINK]), developed from scratch, or other community requirements can be imported into STAPLE (see converting metadata into STAPLE format [LINK]).\nYou can view our JSON validation schema by examining each file LINK. JSON validation schema are used to create the forms you see in the app and to ensure that the output files are formatted correctly.\nYou can view our JSON-LD examples of the output from each schema LINK. These files would be downloaded from STAPLE to share in a repository like GitHub or the Open Science Framework.\nThe image below shows how each type of metadata collected within STAPLE for our minimum standard is related to each other. Each piece is described below with the required components. Within the descriptions below, we denote the official keyword for a object and then the description of what that keyword indicates. These are taken from Schema.org. In the app, they are given more descriptive titles/names to know what to enter in the form.\nFor example:\n\nidentifier –&gt; “Funding number or other identifier:”\naddressLocality –&gt; “City name of the Organization’s Location:”\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"pics/metadata.jpg\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Project\nProjects are separate research endeavors that you want to create information for and track using STAPLE’s features. Projects can be as simple as a manuscript/report/document you want to share, grant applications, data collection, stimuli and translations, etc. Generally, we think of projects as work that will eventually be published, but this is not a necessary requirement.\nRequired elements of project-level metadata (you enter this information):\n\nname: Name of the project\ndescription: Project description\nkeywords: Keywords\ncitation: Citation (should probably break this down into parts)\n\nSuggested elements of project-level metadata (you enter this information):\n\nabstract: Abstract of the project, generally from the paper or more formal than the required description\nidentifier: Persistent identifier (DOI, ISSN, etc.)\npublisher: Publisher (should this be under citation)\n\nOther elements of project-level metadata (that are added automatically):\n\nContributors\nCorresponding Author\nFunders\nDate\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Action\nAction describes all of the tasks completed within STAPLE. This metadata is collected for you by using the app. The following information is collected:\n\nstartTime: The date-time of when the action was assigned if it was a task\nendTime: The date-time of when the action was completed\nagent: The person who assigned the task\nparticipant: The person who completed the task\nresult:\n\nname: The name of the task\ndescription: The description of the task\nsubjectOf: The project title from staple, linked to the project metadata\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Data\nData gets a special type of schema, etc.\nhttps://schema.org/Dataset\n\n3.4.3.1 Primary Data\n\n\n3.4.3.2 Secondary Data\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Project Outputs\nNote that data can be text, but this is the spot we classify other objects you may output.\n\n3.4.4.1 Text\nhttps://schema.org/TextObject\n\n\n3.4.4.2 Audio\nhttps://schema.org/AudioObject\n\n\n3.4.4.3 Video\nhttps://schema.org/VideoObject\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Image\nhttps://schema.org/ImageObject\n\n\n3.4.6 Author\nhttps://schema.org/Person\n\n\n3.4.7 Organization\n\n\n3.4.8 Funder\n\n\n3.4.9 CRediT",

    "text": "4.1.1 User\nA user in STAPLE is a person who has an account and agreed to terms and conditions. Users can create all the elements described below on their own accounts and complete tasks as part of projects that were created an another person’s account.\nUsers have the ability to log in/log out, update their personal information (username, password, email, and profile information), and delete their account. Users also have the ability to add and manage contributors who are part of their projects. They can create teams for individual projects.\nNote: Deleting your account does not delete you from contributions tied to other projects. You will lose the ability to edit those contributions but you must have the administrator of that project delete you from that project if you wish.\n\n4.1.1.1 Project Admin\nA use can be a project administrator:\n\nBy default, those who “create” a project are a project administrator on that project. See the permissions section below for an explanation of what that means.\nAdditional project administrators can be added to individual projects.\n\n\n\n4.1.1.2 Contributor\n\nA user can also be added as a contributor on a project. Contributors have limited access to other projects, generally only able to complete tasks that have been assigned to them.\n\n\n\n4.1.1.3 Teams\n\nTeams are a special type of contributor for projects. Each user can be part of multiple teams within a project. Teams are used for tasks that involve a group of people who need to complete a goal. For example, a data collection team for a project with human subjects will need to complete an ethics application to cover their team for data collection. Therefore, each person gets credit for completing the ethics review, but only one person on the team needs to complete the “task” within STAPLE. Another example could be a team of translators who work on converting materials into Spanish from French. The goal is to provide the final Spanish materials, but the entire team gets credit for completing this task.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Permissions\n\nProject administrators have permissions to edit everything within a project (people, structure [see below], tasks, documentation, and more). They can add, edit, delete, and update all information within a project.\nContributors only have permission to view and edit tasks that are assigned to them, along with the global project information on a project to which they have been added.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Projects\n\n\nProjects are the main organizational structure within STAPLE. Projects are defined by the user but can be thought of as: a research paper, a thesis, a grant application, a meta-analysis, a team report, and more.\nUsers will be able to create, read, update, and delete projects. They can define project roles by adding contributors (and contributor teams) and defining additional project administrators. They can create, update, and delete all the possible options described below (elements, tasks, metadata).\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Tasks\n\nTasks are the “to-do” list within a project. Tasks must be assigned to a project. Each task must have a contributor and/or team assigned to them (and the default is the person who creates the task). Additionally, tasks can include a requirement for documentation. These documentation standards can be selected from our minimum requirement list or can your own options can be uploaded.\nThe documentation will appear as a “form” online for a person to fill out. They will fill in the required information for that type of task (defined by the creator, please see metadata section for types). These form outputs can be updated by the project administrator at any time or can be updated as part of the review process.\nOnce a task has been assigned to a user, the user will get an email to complete the task. At this point, once the user has “completed” the task, the project administrator will receive an email that the task has been completed. They can review the task to ensure it has been completed correctly. If not, they can send the task back to the original user who can then update the task information. This structure is designed in a similar way to GitHub - once a person completes as task, it is reviewed. If ok, the task is marked done, and if not, it requires the original contributor to update and resubmit.\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Elements\n\nElements are a special placeholder within a project. You can create projects entirely without elements. However, many people like to group tasks into larger categories. Elements are storage boxes for groups of tasks or outputs that fit together. For example, you may create an element for a project that contains all the stimuli materials. This element could be assigned tasks such as “upload the stimuli online”, “translate the stimuli into French”, “translate the stimuli in Arabic”, and so on.\nYou can also use elements to label specific sections of a project. For example, you can use elements to hold materials, data, analyses, and the final manuscript, which will put these outputs into labeled sections on the final documentation.\nTasks can be assigned to elements. By assigning a task to an element, you are grouping them together on STAPLE and the final output documentation provided for transparency purposes.\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Dashboard\n\nThe project dashboard allows you to review the elements, tasks, contributors, and documentation available for the project.\nAdditionally, you can view and export a human and machine readable timeline for the project. This documentation will include the project documentation collected from contributors, the element structure of the project, and what each contributor did for the project (and a timestamp of when they did it).",

Researchers can define similarity - how related words are - in multiple ways, so the researcher wishes to clearly document how they calculated similarity using an secondary data source. Further, the researcher used other psycholinguistic databases to see if they could predict the amount of semantic priming in their study based on the characteristics of the words in the study.",

I could have created “data” and put both primary and secondary data within that element. I also could add separate elements for the pre-registration (if applicable) or potentially separate materials and translation into two elements.\nTo do: figure out a view and updating for these.\n\n\n5.1.3 Add Contributors\nFrom the project dashboard, you can click on contributors to add a new person to the project. Note: this process adds them only to that project.\nYou would be able to add contributors by email on this page. It will notify them that you have added them to the project. Once a contributor has been added to a project, you can begin to assign them tasks.\nTo do:\n\nAllow adding by email.\nCreate teams and add contributors to them.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Add Tasks\nIn theory, you could create and run a project with no elements. You would use the task tab for all functionality. To create a task, click on tasks. Note that a lot of task functionality is not available yet, but we will pretend it is.\nWhen creating a task, you will define:\n\nThe task name\nThe task description or a how-to complete the task\nThe element a task should be assigned to (or none)\nThe person or team associated with the task\nIf the task needs an “output” (something that needs metadata)\nIf so, what type of metadata should the task include?\n\nOnce you create a task, the information on what needs to be done will be emailed to the user or team with the task information. They (or you) will be able to complete the task, and information about when the task was assigned and completed will be stored.\nIf the task has been tagged with needing an output - you will then need to enter the metadata for the requested output. For example, I created a task called “upload IRB documents”. In this case, the required output would be ethics approval for the study. I would store that document in my favorite repository (OSF, GitHub, FigShare, etc.) and create a permanent link for the document. Then I would enter the required metadata for that document. In this case, it would be a simple explanation of what the text document contains.\nTo do:\n\nAllow tasks to be tagged within element.\nView tasks within elements pages.\nAllow tasks to be tagged with a person or team.\nAllow tasks to be tagged with “needs metadata” or not.\nProvide example of difference in metadata for primary and secondary data.\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Project Outputs\nTo do: Add examples for each type of metadata here. Please see the Metadata section at the moment.\n\n\n5.1.6 Project Completion\nWhen all tasks are complete and all metadata is entered for the project outputs, you can build a project timeline from the dashboard page. This information will present:\n\nWhat was done on a project with a timestamp (example)\n\nWho/When a task was assigned\nWho/When a task was completed\nWho/When metadata was added\nWho/When elements were created\nAnd so on\n\nA machine readable format of all the metadata for the study\nA contributorship output matching the model you wish to use\n\nFor example, tagged CRediT categories\n\n\nTo do: update dashboard to include this option.",

Use the following (not the # line, these are notes) to install packages, tailwind, and daisyui.\n\n# to install all packages for staple\nnpm install\n# install tailwind css\nblitz install tailwind\n# install daisyui\nnpm i -D daisyui@latest\n\nNext, use the following line to create the database structure/schema for STAPLE to run.\n\n# to create database with the right set up\nblitz prisma generate\nblitz prisma migrate dev\n\n\n6.2.7 Starting the App - Local Testing\n\nIn a terminal window, go to the folder you cloned this repository and type:\n\nblitz dev\n\nOpen (usually) http://localhost:3000 (or whatever it says for localhost in the terminal) with your browser to see the result.\nThis step works great on a “regular” computer, but may not be useful for a server. Instead run the service “in production” to view on your website.\n\n\n\n6.2.8 Starting the App - Production\n\nIn a terminal window, go to the folder you cloned this repository and type:\n\nblitz build\n\nThis step may produce errors in the build. You will need to fix these errors before running the application. Check below for common issues.\n\n\n\n6.2.9 Keeping the App Going\n\nCreate a service.\nGenerally, you might consider putting it here: /etc/systemd/system/ on a linux machine.\nWe’ve named the file blitz.service as an example creating it using nano.\nTutorial for those who do not know how to do this - Installation Instructions\n\n# for example \nerin@staple:/var/www/html/STAPLE$ cd /etc/systemd/system/\nerin@staple:/etc/systemd/system$ nano blitz.service\n\nExample file structure:\nChange the WorkingDirectory to your folder.\n\n[Unit]\nDescription=Starts the Blitz service.\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nWorkingDirectory=/var/www/html/STAPLE\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/blitz start\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=default.target\n\nCommands:\n\nstop: sudo systemctl stop blitz\nstart: sudo systemctl start blitz\nrestart: sudo systemctl restart blitz\nreload: sudo systemctl reload blitz\ndisable: sudo systemctl disable blitz\nre-enable: sudo systemctl enable blitz\nstatus: sudo systemctl status blitz\nreset: sudo systemctl reset-failed blitz\n\n\nMany thanks to Scott B. for setting this up and giving instructions.\n\nRun sudo systemctl start blitz.\nCheck the status using sudo systemctl status blitz. Type the letter q to exit.\nStatus can also help you troubleshoot when you have an error.\n\n\n\n6.2.10 Setting Up the Proxy\n\nUse the following to get to the nginx web server: cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled\nCreate a file by using nano YOURWEBSITE … for example ours is nano app.staple.science because that is the website of our hosted version of STAPLE.\nCreate the server file setup:\n\n# Default server configuration\n#\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name app.staple.science;\n    error_log /var/www/html/YOURFOLDER/logs/web-server.log;\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;\n    }\n}\n\nFor https you need to set up a certificate and the easiest solution is through certbot.
